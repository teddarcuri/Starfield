Starfield
=========
A Simple Javascript Starfield Class with Twinkle Animation

Demo: starfield.teddarcuri.com

- Class based starfield with settable options.
- Nice CSS flicker animation that doesn't completely destroy browser performance.
- Just something I built for fun to further my understanding of JS "objects" and using javascript without relying on the Jquery library
